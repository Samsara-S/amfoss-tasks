#                           UBUNTU 21.04LTS
Things were complicated for me right from start, I have i3 4 gen processor Laptop that makes turning on Web browser on a  Windows 11  operating systema task itself.Honestly changing into 
to linux based Distro actually enchanced my laptop's efficiency and capabilities particularly the Execution time for command given.

Although i have a linux based operating system its not an actually Ubuntu,mine's Zorin which i had replaced with windows during my Higher Secondary years (- similar to ubuntu with terminal commands and sudo apt--)
but i decided took the challenge an actually helped my friend Dual boot with ubuntu butthere was the risk of deleting windows while creating  partition of ubuntu ,the problem with Windows bitLocker Encryption was actually annoying .
                                               let me give link that solve my dual boot problems
