  Things were complicated for me right from start, I have i3 4 gen processor Laptop 
that makes turning on browser on Windows 11 a task itself.Honestly changing  into to linux based Distro operating system actually enchanced my laptop's  efficiency and capabilities particulary   execution time for my command has  significantly reduced.

Although i have a linux based operating system its not an actually Ubuntumine's Zorin which i had replaced with windows during my Higher Secondary years (- similar to ubuntu with terminal commands and sudo apt--).
but i decided took the challenge an actually helped my friend Dual boot with ubuntu
there was the risk of deleting windows while creating  partition of ubuntu ,the problem with Windows bot locker Encryption was actually annoying .let me 
give you link that solve my dual boot problems
